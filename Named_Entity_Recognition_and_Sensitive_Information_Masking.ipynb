        "\n",
        "1. Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Person Names using SpaCy:\n",
        "We will use SpaCy, a powerful NLP library, to identify and mask names of people mentioned in the text. NER helps us automatically detect specific entities like person names, organizations, locations, and more for text data analysis and privacy protection.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Hiding Emails, Phone Numbers, and URLs using the clean-text Library:\n",
        "Apart from identifying person names, we often need to anonymize other sensitive information, such as email addresses and URLs. For this task, we will use the clean-text library, which provides simple and effective functions to clean and standardize text data by removing or masking unwanted patterns like emails, URLs, and phone numbers. It also allows us to perform further data cleaning, which is why I will include those lines in the code block.\n",

Whether working with customer data, social media content, or any other text data, it's crucial to anonymize identifiable information to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and to maintain trust with users."
